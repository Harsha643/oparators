    \
// 1. Eligibility Check
// Write a condition to check if a student is eligible for a scholarship. The criteria are:
// - The students grade is A or B.
// - The students attendance is above 75%.
// Use a ternary operator to assign "Eligible" or "Not Eligible" to a variable.

        2. Age Group Classification
        Classify a person based on their age:
         - If the age is less than 13, they are a “Child”.
         - If the age is between 13 and 19 (inclusive), they are a “Teenager”.
         - Otherwise, they are an “Adult”.
         Use nested ternary operators to determine the classification.
    </pre>

        3. Login Status
        Check the login status of a user. A user is considered logged in if:
         - isLoggedIn is true.
         - Their session is active (sessionActive is true).
         Use a ternary operator to log "Welcome Back" if the user is logged in and "Please Log In" otherwise.

        4. Grade Evaluation
        Assign a letter grade based on a student’s score:
         - Scores 90 and above: "A".
         - Scores between 80 and 89: "B".
         - Scores between 70 and 79: "C".
         - Scores below 70: "Fail".
         Use nested ternary operators to determine the grade.

        5. Product Discount Validation
        Determine the discount for a product based on the following criteria:
         - If the product price is greater than $100, the discount is 20%.
         - Otherwise, the discount is 10%.
         Use a ternary operator to set the discount percentage.
